Local Liquidator is a webapp for reselling textbooks very locally, as in within walking distance.
***

The webapp relies on Elm to do front-end user input validation and display for most pages.
Some notable features include utilizing the browser's geolocation api (sending geolocation coordinates from JavaScript to Elm),
combining various parameters from different Elm modules into single AJAX requests, parsing returned JSON data,
and incorporating Elm code into HTML and/or PHP workflows.

## To Do

* Google Maps integration ( JS <-> Elm )
* Additional Login Methods ( e.g. Facebook, Google )
* Explore alternative methods of interfacing front- and back-end code
