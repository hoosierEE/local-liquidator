Local Liquidator is a webapp for reselling textbooks locally, as in within walking distance.

## /JS

This is where we store pure JavaScript files, which will be referenced by our Elm program.

## /HTML

The files in here are the result after compiling the Elm code.

## /HTML/welcome.html

This is a mock-up of the basic visual elements in our program.  Also demonstrates dynamic layout (portrait, landscape)
and text that updates as you type, which are pretty easy in Elm and much more cumbersome in JavaScript.
