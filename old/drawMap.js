//This file should accept as parameters:
// a pair of coordinates for a center position
// a list of markers which contain positions and text descriptions

//Based on these inputs this function should return a map using the Google Maps API which
// is centered on the "center position" and also displays the markers.

//Other potential parameters:
// a rectangle of lat/lng bounds for setting the bounds of our map
// other info such as <boolean> buySellStatus which could be used to make buyer markers 
//  visually different from seller markers
